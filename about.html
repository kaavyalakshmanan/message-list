    <div id="about-me"> <p> Hello! My name is Kaavya and I am 4th year BCS student. I love reading, running, and dogs. I have completed an 
        internship in software development, internship in data science, and have just started my 3rd internship where I hope to combine 
        both. I am currently taking CPSC 436 where we learn Industry Skills related to software development. As part of our first 
        assignment, we are tasked with creating a message list website using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. I hope you enjoy my site! </p></div>
